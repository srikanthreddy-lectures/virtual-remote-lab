      "scenario":"In this activity, you will use Wireshark and tcpdump to capture network traffic and display relevant information on the local network. Interpreting the output from such captures is useful for security assessments.",
      "objective":"Use the Kali Linux virtual machine to capture some network traffic and identify the main features of the Wireshark network analyzer. You'll assume that KALI has been able to obtain some sort of network tap, which has been simulated for you already by configuring port mirroring on the Hyper-V switch. \\ From the Application > Internet, select the Wireshark application.\\ Maximize the window to make Wireshark easier to work with.\\ Under Capture, select the eth0 adapter. \\ In the Capture filter box, type ip.\\ The ip filter captures IPv4 traffic, not IPv6 traffic.\\ There are two types of filters: capture restricts which frames the sniffer records while display filters (but does not discard) what has been recorded. The syntax of capture and display filters is different, and capture filters are more basic.\\ Start the capture by selecting the blue Start capturing packets button in the upper left corner of the Wireshark interface.\\ Launch Firefox from the menu, and then connect to http://10.1.0.2 (the MS1 Windows web server).\\ As soon as the 515support web page is displayed in Firefox, switch back to the Wireshark application.\\ In this task, you are capturing packets on the PT1-Kali VM and connecting to the MS1 web server from the same Kali VM.",
